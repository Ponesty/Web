The internet works by sending data from one device to another. This data is sent in the form of electrical signals. In coding we see the data as lines of code. From my understanding we put the data in objects. These objects and be sent or received. They also need to be tranlated so the receiver can read the data and do the requested instructions.
When clicking on a link, an event listener attachted to the link will initiate code that will transfer the user to the page that link is connected to. I think the transfer works by sending a request to the server and the server providing the data that was requested, so long as the data requested exists.
